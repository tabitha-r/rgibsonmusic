<!-- UPDATING EXAMPLES -->
## Updating

Basic information like contact details, social media accounts, CV points, and upcoming events can be easily updated using the relevant `.json` files in the `assets/data` directory. 

JSON files are set up as a collection of `"key": "value"` pairs. Be careful, unless the value is a number or true or false, they will need quotation marks around them. For example `"year": 2024` is fine, as is `"show": true`, but `"title": "Feedback Piano"` require the quotes. Also make sure to leave all the curly brackets (`{ }`) and commas in place.

1. To edit any of these, first navigate to the `assets/data/` directory

### Updating Contact

To update contact information for the CV and contact pages, edit the `contact.json` file.

2. From the `assets/data` directory, click `contact.json`
3. In the top right, click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. Update the relevant field with new information.
    ```json
    {
        "contact": {
            "email": "new@email.here",
            "phone": "+44 (0) 098 765 4321"
        }
    }
    ```
5. Click the green 'Commit Changes' button in the top right.
6. Wait for the website to re-deploy

### Updating Social

To update social media accounts for the footer, edit the `socials.json` file. The most popular social media platforms should automatically get the correct icon, otherwise it will need to be added by Tabitha.

2. From the `assets/data` directory, click `socials.json`
3. In the top right, click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. Copy the JSON below (including the comma at the beginning)
    ```json
    ,
    {
            "platform": "",
            "platform_descriptor": "",
            "link": "",
            "link_descriptor": "Rachael Gibson on ",
            "weight": 
    }
    ```
5. Paste it after the last entry's `}`, before the last `] }`
    ```json
    //...
            "link_descriptor": "Rachael Gibson on Soundcloud",
                "weight": 20
            }->PASTE HERE<-
        ]
    }
    ```
6. Begin to fill in the fields. The `"platform"` field should have no spaces, doesn't need any capitals, and will be used to get the icon from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?f=brands&o=r). The `"platform_descriptor"` can be a grammatically correct version of the platform name.
    ```json
    "platform": "facebook",
    "platform_descriptor": "Facebook",
    ```
7. The `"link"` field should be the URL to the account, and the `"link_descriptor"` field likely will follow the format of `"Rachael Gibson on [platform]"`
    ```json
    "link": "https://www.facebook.com/exampleuser/",
    "link_descriptor": "Rachael Gibson on Facebook",
    ```
8. The `"weight"` field is the order the icons will appear. The lower the weight, the earlier the link will appear in the list and the higher, the later. In general, just +10 to the last weight unless you want to give this link more prominence.
    ```json
    "weight": 30
    ```
9. Click the green 'Commit Changes' button in the top right.
10. Wait for the website to re-deploy

### Updating Latest

This controls the 'Coming Up' section on the homepage. This can be used to advertise upcoming concerts, events, releases etc.

2. From the `assets/data` directory, click `latest.json`
3. In the top right, click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. Copy the JSON below (including the comma at the beginning)
    ```json
    ,
    {
            "show": true,
            "title": "",
            "description": "",
            "date": "",
            "time": "",
            "location": "",
            "location_google_url": "",
            "link": "",
            "link_label": ""
    }
    ```
5. Paste it after the last entry's `}`, before the last `] }`
    ```json
    {
        [
            {
            //...
            "location": "O2 Academy, Liverpool",
            "link": "https://www.tabithariley.co.uk/"
            } // ->PASTE HERE<-
        ]
    }
    ```
6. Begin to fill in the fields. The `"show"` field determines whether it is shown on the website, this means you can hide something that's already happened or keep a draft hidden. This can be `true` or `false` and doesn't need quotation marks. This is a required field.
    ```json
    "show": true,
    ```
7. The `"title"` and `"description"` fields are fairly self explanatory: what is the event? These fields are required.
    ```json
    "title": "New Composition Release",
    "description": "Rachael will be releasing her latest composition on her social media as well as in person at this Event.",
    ```
8. The `"date"` and `"time"` fields are the date and time of the events. These are optional fields if it is not an event at a specific time, and you can have one without the other. The `"date"` field should be in the format of 'dd mmm yy', for example: '24 Aug 24'. The `"time"` can be whatever format you like.
    ```json
    "date": "19 Jan 25",
    "time": "1:00pm",
    ```
9. The `"location"` and `"location_google_url"` fields present the event location. Again, these are optional if it is not at a physical location, and you can have location without the Google URL but you cannot have the Google URL without the location. `"location"` is the name of the venue, and `"location_google_url"` can be used to link to the venue on Google Maps (Find the venue on Google Maps, and then click 'share' and copy the URL).
    ```json
    "location": "Lime Street Station, Liverpool",
    "location_google_url": "https://maps.app.goo.gl/bUwaYQHpa7HHH2vp7",
    ```
10. The `"link"` and `"link_label"` fields are very versatile. These are the link buttons. If there is more information on a different website, or a place to buy tickets etc., you can use these fields. If a `"link"` is provided but no `"link_label"` the button will default to 'Learn More'. You can also use Emojis in the label!
    ```json
    "link": "https://www.seaty.co.uk/",
    "link_label": "Book Your Place!"
    ```
11. Click the green 'Commit Changes' button in the top right.
12. Wait for the website to re-deploy

### Updating CV

Updating the CV is a little more complex than the previous JSON files, just because the JSON file is bigger.

2. From the `assets/data` directory, click `cv.json`
3. In the top right, click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. This JSON file is split into four arrays (lists).
    ```json
    {
        "works": [
            //...
        ],
        "residencies": [
            //...
        ],
        "education": [
            //...
        ],
        "employment": [
            //...
        ]
    }
    ```

#### Updating Works

5. Find the `"works"` section of the JSON file.
6. Copy the following JSON (including the comma at the beginning)
    ```json
    ,
    {
            "title": "",
            "year": 2024,
            "description": "",
            "show": true
    }
    ```
7. Paste it after the last entry's `}`, before the last `] }`
    ```json
    {
        [
            {
                //...
                "description": "",
                "show": true
            } // ->PASTE HERE<->
    ],
    "residencies": [
        //...
    ]
    ```
8. Fill in the fields, they are all fairly self-explanatory. `"year"` and `"show"` do not need quotation marks, while `"title"` and `"description"` do.
    ```json
    {
            "title": "My Next Amazing Composition",
            "year": 2025,
            "description": "for ukulele",
            "show": true
    }
    ```
9. Click the green 'Commit Changes' button in the top right.
10. Wait for the website to re-deploy

#### Updating Residencies

5. Find the `"residencies"` section of the JSON file.
6. Copy the following JSON (including the comma at the beginning)
    ```json
    ,
        {
            "programme": "",
            "year": 2024,
            "role": "Participant",
            "additional_info": "",
            "show": false
        }
    ```
7. Paste it after the last entry's `}`, before the last `] }`
    ```json
    [ 
        {
        //...
        "additional_info": "",
        "show": true
        } // ->PASTE HERE<->
    ],
    "education": [
        //...
    ]
    ```
8. Begin to fill in the fields. `"programme"` is the name of the residency/workshop/programme.
    ```json
    "programme": "Ukuleleists United 2024/2025",
    ```
9. The `"year"` field is versatile. If it is a single year, then quotation marks aren't needed. However, if it is over multiple years, this can be written with a hypen or slash and wrapped in quotation marks.
    ```json
    "year": 2025,
        // OR
    "year": "2024/2025",
    ```
10. The `"role"` field is filled in with 'Participant' by default but this can be changed to whatever role required.
    ```json
    "role": "Workshop Leader",
    ```
11. The `"additional_info"` field can be used for whatever additional sentence(s) you want to add. These will only be shown as a plain sentence so try to keep it simple.
    ```json
    "additional_info": "Part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival"
    ```
12. Click the green 'Commit Changes' button in the top right.
13. Wait for the website to re-deploy

#### Updating Education

5. Find the `"education"` section of the JSON file.
6. Copy the following JSON (including the comma at the beginning)
    ```json
    ,
        {
            "institution": "",
            "course_name": "",
            "start_date": "",
            "end_date": "",
            "grade": "",
            "current": false,
            "modules": [],
            "additional_info": "",
            "show": true
        }
    ```
7. Paste it after the last entry's `}`, before the last `] }`
    ```json
    [
        {
            //...
            "additional_info": "",
            "show": false
        } //->PASTE HERE<-
    ],
    "employment": [
        //...
    ]
    ```
8. Begin to fill in the fields. The `"institution"` is the university, school, or provider of the course, which is thr `"course_name"` field. 
    ```json
    "institution": "Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts",
    "course_name": "MA Actor Musicianship",
    ```
9. The `"start_date"` and `"end_date"` are for the beginning and end of the course. These should be wrapped in quotations and can be the date, such as 'September 2007' or just '2007', or a word like 'present' or 'ongoing'.
    ```json
    "start_date": "September 2021",
    "end_date": "July 2022",
        // OR
    "start_date": "2023",
    "end_date": "present",
    ```
10. The `"grade"` field can be left empty if the course is ongoing, or include the received grade.
    ```json
    "grade": "Distinction"
    ```
11. The `"current"` field indicates whether the course is ongoing. If it is finished, `"current"` will be `false`. If it is still ongoing, it will be `true`.
    ```json
    "current": true
        // OR
    "current": false
    ```
12. The `"modules"` field is a little more complicated. Between the square brackets `[ ]` you can include as many words/sentences/phrases as you like separated by commas. These can be on one line or split up onto new lines. This can also be left as empty brackets `[]`.
    ```json
    "modules": ["composition", "interactive music systems", "studio practice", "thesis"],
        // OR
    "modules": [
        "MUSI130 – Introduction to Classical Music History",

        "MUSI380 – Exploring Rhythm, Form and Musical Time"
    ],
        // OR
    "modules": [],
    ```
13. The `"additional_info"` field can be used for whatever additional sentence(s) you want to add. These will only be shown as a plain sentence so try to keep it simple. It can be left blank.
    ```json
    "additional_info": "Funded by WBL Inc."
    ```
14. The `"show"` field controls whether this information is displayed.
    ```json
    "show": true
        // OR
    "show": false
    ```
15. Click the green 'Commit Changes' button in the top right.
16. Wait for the website to re-deploy

    ```
11. The `"modules"` field is a little more complicated. Between the square brackets `[ ]` you can include as many words/sentences/phrases as you like separated by commas. These can be on one line or split up onto new lines. This can also be left as empty brackets `[]`.
