This is in response to how installations that feature audience interaction typically use the audience members as controllers, catalysts or performers, but audiences rarely have the opportunity to contribute their own ideas within a sound installation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Destroy My Heartstrings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a guitarist, I am interested in exploring ways of presenting sonically ideas surrounding gender and the electric guitar. Guitar and gender have been widely discussed in pop culture as well as academia, with both addressing similar questions of why there aren’t more female guitarists becoming as commercially successful as their male counterparts and how our relationship to the instrument differs in comparison to men.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For inspiration I decided to seek out music by female guitar players that didn’t conform to conventional ‘guitar music’ used in folk, blues, indie rock or metal. This included Susan Alcorn, an experimental lap steel guitarist who uses a lot of extended techniques such as balancing slate on the strings and creating drones as seen in &lt;a&#xD;&#xA;    href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l187khHMzIs&#34;&#xD;&#xA;    target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xD;&#xA;    rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    this improvisation&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square&#34; role=&#34;img&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;fa-sr-only fa-sr-only-focusable&#34;&gt;Link will open in a new tab&lt;/span&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;. I felt that this was an interesting approach because of the way it treated the instrument as as a tool for exploration. In addition to this, I was interested in No-Wave bands such as Bikini Kill and the ‘deskilled’ approaches to the guitar used in songs such as ‘Thurston Hearts the Who’ . Although I felt that Bikini Kill in some ways were conforming to the ‘bad girl’ punk which proves the rule of guitar representing masculine traits such as rebellion and aggression, I was interested using the instrument as more of a ‘noise maker’  through their approach to the instrument rather than focusing on generating musical material such as licks, chords or harmonic progressions commonly used in guitar-based music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>INTERNAL / EXTERNAL</title>

      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;iframe-figure iframe-figure__vimeo&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;iframe title=&#34;vimeo-player&#34; src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/351190550?h=df175dbb06&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;    allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERNAL / EXTERNAL by Beth Madeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;iframe-src&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://player.vimeo.com/video/351190550?h=df175dbb06&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTERNAL / EXTERNAL, by Beth Madeley, is based on the idea of using animation as ‘therapy’ by exploring stream-of-consciousness frame by frame and free-writing to externalize internal feelings left from trauma. In this animation video, I worked very closely with the animator in discussing what she wanted to achieve sonically; however, we did not follow traditional working methods in order to achieve this. We wanted to create a soundtrack which complemented the visuals but wasn’t directly related to them by being created before for the animator to work with, I was asked to approach the music in a similar way to how the artist approached the animation, as a ‘therapy’ on an instrument before looking at the video. This was achieved through recording different improvisations over multiple sessions exploring my own stream of consciousness, using a violin which was mic’d up and sent thorough delay and reverb pedals. These recordings were then cut, and I added additional sounds where necessary in post once the video was sent to me to edit against in order to emphasise important changes in the visual narrative. I decided to use the violin as it was an instrument I felt could use to create a sense of intimacy and had a lot of sonic potential using extended techniques such as rubbing and tapping the body of the instrument as well as breathing and whispering into the ‘f’ holes, whilst at the same time maintaining a coherent sound world. Because the animation is abstract and not designed to accurately portray real world visuals as closely, I felt this allowed more room to play with sound design and musical material to add to this more abstract visual world that the artist had created. It would be interesting in future to explore how maybe the manipulation of real-world sounds could create a different perspective on the visual material and how a duo or larger ensemble could approach this idea of improvisation as therapy for an animated film based on these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanderscapes&lt;/em&gt; - Royal Court Theatre – Wigan Old Courts&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Installation piece for the &lt;em&gt;Wanderscapes&lt;/em&gt; Project by the Old Courts, Wigan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This piece was written as part of the &lt;em&gt;Wanderscapes&lt;/em&gt;: Social Resonances sound and music audio walk commissioned by The Old Courts Wigan, released July 2021. The piece contains a mix of samples including cinema projectors, audiences, orchestral instruments and on site construction sounds at the Royal Court alongside original music to represent the history and the development of the building, which is currently in restoration. These sounds slowly develop and change as the piece travels through each point in time to create a structure which slowly unravels and constantly shifts, like the theatre has in the way it’s been repurposed and rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Original Music for Whatstick Theatre’s production of &lt;em&gt;Contractions&lt;/em&gt;, written by Mike Bartlett. For this production, the music uses a mix of repetitive, minimalist motifs on percussive strings to create movement. The music is semi-inspired by baroque dances, as well as textures and drones inspired by the breath and body, transitioning from rigid, rhythmic music to freer, breathy textures as the play develops. Below is the main theme which is played at the beginning and end of the play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I asked members of the local community and friends with different levels of knowledge around musical score making to create a new graphic score using different materials, which were to be placed onto a spinning piece of card on a record player. This was to help aid with the creation of these scores as a stimulus and starting point to consider, as a lot of the participants had never done this before. Some examples are included below. These scores were then taken to musicians with different levels of experience in improvisation and graphic score notation to interpret and record.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Reach Out Into Darkness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Reach Out Into Darkness&lt;/em&gt; is a postcard piece for any pitched solo instrument written for the Illuminate Women’s Music season 1 2020 Online concert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This piece aims to shift our focus in music making from using our instruments as a tool for specific sound making within a composition and towards the relationship between our bodies, instruments and what sounds occur when we pay attention to what and how we feel. I wanted to accomplish a piece which features a more fixed opening, with set pitches for all to follow. However, as the piece develops it becomes more personal and changes depending on the instrument and person&#xA;performing and how they choose to explore touch and what it means to them as a performer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
