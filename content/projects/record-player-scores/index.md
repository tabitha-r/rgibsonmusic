This is one of the sections of an improvisation workshop I ran during my time at Goldsmiths. I asked members of the local community and friends with different levels of knowledge around musical score making to create a new graphic score using different materials, which were to be placed onto a spinning piece of card on a record player. This was to help aid with the creation of these scores as a stimulus and starting point to consider, as a lot of the participants had never done this before. Some examples are included below. These scores were then taken to musicians with different levels of experience in improvisation and graphic score notation to interpret and record.
