This is one of the sections of an improvisation workshop I ran during my time at Goldsmiths. It features participants with a range of musical backgrounds, from pop musicians, classically trained musicians and those with no musical experience. They were asked to improvise together using wearable ‘scores’, using a device which sent impulses of different strengths and speeds to the wearer (image right). We used these as a guide for different musical elements including chord changes, textures and dynamics.
