*Wanderscapes* - Royal Court Theatre – Wigan Old Courts

Installation piece for the *Wanderscapes* Project by the Old Courts, Wigan.

This piece was written as part of the *Wanderscapes*: Social Resonances sound and music audio walk commissioned by The Old Courts Wigan, released July 2021. The piece contains a mix of samples including cinema projectors, audiences, orchestral instruments and on site construction sounds at the Royal Court alongside original music to represent the history and the development of the building, which is currently in restoration. These sounds slowly develop and change as the piece travels through each point in time to create a structure which slowly unravels and constantly shifts, like the theatre has in the way it’s been repurposed and rebuilt.
