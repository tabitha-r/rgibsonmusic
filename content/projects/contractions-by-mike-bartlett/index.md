Original Music for Whatstick Theatre’s production of *Contractions*, written by Mike Bartlett. For this production, the music uses a mix of repetitive, minimalist motifs on percussive strings to create movement. The music is semi-inspired by baroque dances, as well as textures and drones inspired by the breath and body, transitioning from rigid, rhythmic music to freer, breathy textures as the play develops. Below is the main theme which is played at the beginning and end of the play.
