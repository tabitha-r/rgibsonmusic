Rachael Gibson is a guitarist and composer based in Merseyside. Her practice has become increasingly focused on the exploration of tactile approaches to music-making and engagement. She is particularly interested in how alternative notation practices and technology can be used to musically interrogate the relationship between touch and performance.

Rachael is currently undertaking a PhD in Composition at the University of Liverpool, funded by the {{< abbr abbr="NWCDTP" meaning="North West Consortium Doctoral Training Partnership" >}}.

Recently, she has been a participant in the Britten Pears Young Artist scheme 23/24 (Composition Alternative Practice and Performance Art), created installation work at the Old Courts Wigan as part of the Wanderscapes Project and was one of the participants in the Yorkshire Sound Womenâ€™s Network Sound Pioneers Residency.

Alongside her works for chamber ensembles, Rachael has composed music for theatre, short films and organisations including Whatstick Theatre, The Coach House (in partnership with the Everyman Theatre Liverpool), Twisted Showcase Productions, Claire House Childrenâ€™s Hospice and DaDa Fest.
